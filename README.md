## Exercise 6: Continuous Integration
[[Official website](https://www.sscardapane.it/teaching/reproducibledl/)]

This is the completed version of **exercise 6** (unit testing and formatting with continuous integration). In order to run the pre-commit hook, move `pre-commit` to `.git/hooks/`.

See the initial instructions:

```bash
git checkout exercise5_wandb
```

You can inspect the commits to look at specific changes in the code:

```bash
git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate
```

This exercise concludes the course. I hope you enjoyed it! Feel free to contact me or open an issue if you want to provide any feedback.
